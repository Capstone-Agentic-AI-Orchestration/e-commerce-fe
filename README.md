_Scaffolded by Alpha. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` before running._

## CI/CD

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs unit tests with coverage, lint and a security scan on every push and pull request to `dev`, `uat` and `main` (from `Capstone-Agentic-AI-Orchestration/alphaorch-workflow@v1:workflow-templates/product/fe-react.yml`).

Work lands on `dev`, is promoted to `uat`, then to `main`, by pull request only.

Hosting on **Vercel** is set up automatically by Alpha. See its status, URLs and deploys from this repository’s project in Alpha.
